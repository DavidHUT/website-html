        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is David Hernandez Martinez, and I am 23 years old. I was 
          born in Mexico but moved to Los Angeles California when I was only 
          9 months old. I like to ride motorcyles,go the gym, play video games,
          explore new places and watch movies when I have some free time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I served a mission in St. George Utah and I have been home for 2 years. 
          I am a huge fan of music, and I really like to listen to everything 
          (yes that includes country music) so, youll never see me without some 
          sort of earphones/headphones nearby.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is my start up project and I want to make a small app that lets you create groups tailored 
          to specifit events and only lets people with the groupID join so you can keep the group a secret from 
          unwanted freinds.

        <p>
          Simon is a game that testes the users memory, it will flash 
          a light and you as the user have to memorize what light it flashed. 
          As the game goes on the sequence of lights will increase. 
          How far will you go?
